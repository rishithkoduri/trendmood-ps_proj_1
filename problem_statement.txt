Real-Time Social Media Sentiment Analysis
This project involves building a web application that can determine the sentiment of a social media post or any given text. The user will be able to enter text into a user-friendly frontend, which will then communicate with a backend server. The backend will use a Hugging Face API to connect with a powerful language model that analyzes the text and returns its sentiment as "Positive," "Negative," or "Neutral."

Dataset: Social Media Sentiments Analysis Dataset
The "Social Media Sentiments Analysis Dataset" from Kaggle is a collection of texts from various social media platforms, designed for tasks like sentiment analysis. This dataset is perfect for understanding how emotions and opinions are expressed online and can be used to test the accuracy of your sentiment analysis model.​

Frontend Development
Technology: The frontend will be built using ReactJS, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Functionality:

A simple and clean user interface with a text input field for the user to enter a social media post or any other text.

An "Analyze" button that, when clicked, sends the text to the backend.

A display area to show the returned sentiment from the backend.

Backend Development
Technology: A Node.js server with the Express.js framework will handle the backend logic.

Functionality:

An API endpoint that receives the text from the React frontend.

This endpoint will make a call to the Hugging Face Inference API, passing the text to a pre-trained sentiment analysis model.

The backend will then send the sentiment classification back to the frontend.

Hugging Face API and Model
API: You will use the Hugging Face Inference API, which allows you to easily use state-of-the-art models without having to host them yourself.

Model: For this project, a great choice would be a model specifically fine-tuned for social media text, such as cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment. This model is based on RoBERTa and has been trained on a large number of tweets, making it highly effective at understanding the nuances of social media language. Other models for sentiment analysis are also available on the Hugging Face Hub.​

User Interface (UI)
A minimalist design with a clear text box and a button.

The result should be displayed in a clear and easy-to-read format, for example, by showing the sentiment label (e.g., "POSITIVE") and a confidence score.​

You could also add a feature to show a history of recent analyses.
